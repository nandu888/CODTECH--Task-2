**Project Name :** WRITE A JAVA APPLICATION THAT CONSUMES A PUBLIC REST API (E.G., FETCHING WEATHER DATA) AND DISPLAYS THE DATA IN A
STRUCTURED FORMAT.
**Overview of the Problem**
The task is to develop a Java application that interacts with a public REST API, fetches data (e.g., weather data), and displays the retrieved information in a structured and user-friendly format. The application will handle HTTP requests, parse JSON responses, and present the data in a readable manner.

**Key Components of the Problem:**
REST API Consumption:

The application will consume a public REST API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API for weather data).

It will send HTTP GET requests to the API endpoint to fetch data.

HTTP Request Handling:

The application will use Java libraries like java.net.HttpURLConnection or third-party libraries like Apache HttpClient or OkHttp to send HTTP requests.

JSON Parsing:

The API response will be in JSON format.

The application will parse the JSON response using libraries like org.json, Gson, or Jackson.

Data Display:

The parsed data will be displayed in a structured format (e.g., console output or a simple GUI).

Error Handling:

The application will handle potential errors, such as network issues, API rate limits, or invalid responses.
